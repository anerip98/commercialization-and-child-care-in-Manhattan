# Commercialization and Child Care in Manhattan

This repository contains a report and presentation on the spatial distribution of commercialization and child-care services in Manhattan. The work was done as part of a mid-semester course project for Advanced Spatial Analytics-Spring'22 (SP22_CUSP-GX_6009_1_A) at NYU CUSP.

It tries to assess whether the demand for child care services are being met in all census tracts, and the relationship between the presence of child care services and median income of a neighborhood. 

Arcmap was used to assimilate census data and derive results and analyses for the project.
